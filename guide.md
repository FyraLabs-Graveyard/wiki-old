## What Should I Know About Linux Before I Pick My First Distro?

[Linux is very diverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions), it is often very common for people to get overwhelmed by the sheer choice it has to offer.

We advise you to look at Linux as it's own thing, and not something like "Windows but better/worse" or "MacOS but better/worse". They have their own target audience, have their own issues and their own strengths. You are obviously entitled to your opinion and we respect all communities and their opinions.

Linux is obviously not perfect for all, there is no distro which is "all size fits one", although some distros may attempt to act as such, in reality, it often may prove difficult to keep all sides satisfied with that approach.

"Freedom" in Linux is a very vague term as well. You are "free" to use it, "free" to do whatever you want with it and "free" to or not to contribute towards the project. Linux is a community project after all, which happens to be backed by large corporations which help keep it afloat and also contribute towards the project just like others, but perhaps on a different scale.

## Fundamentals And Linux Nomenclature To Get You Started

We will be discussing things like what a Desktop Environment(from here on referred as DE) is, how it will affect your experience, what is Xorg (also interchangeable mentioned as X11) or Wayland, state of Nvidia and its drivers, etc. 

Since it will be difficult to explain everything in great detail, we will be trying to compress the information provided by focussing on the main highlights, while also redirecting you to better sources if you are interested in reading or learning further.

This is a guide for beginners after all.

## What is "Desktop Environment" And How Should It Affect Me?

To put it simply, a Desktop Environment (from here on referred as DE) is suite of tools and software, ranging from your Window Manager(Discussed further later), all the way to your file manager and even your text editor. Consider it as more of an ecosystem consisting of various pieces of utilities, if you will.

It comes pre-installed on most linux distros and comes in many varieties, but the most common one is GNOME, which is usually the default DE on most distributions.

It provides you with an environment to work in and is the face of your linux installation. Some can be very minimalistic, focused on having the least footprint on your system resources by as much as possible, to some giving fine control over the settings and looks of your interface, so on and so forth.

As with most things in Linux (and Open Source in general), there are politics involved here as well. You are advised to use whatever DE you feel comfortable with, and if you are not sure, you can always try out a few and see which one works for you.
