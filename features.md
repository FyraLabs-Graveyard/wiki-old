## Free For You To Keep

Ultramarine Linux is free to use by all entities and will keep all of its components free of charge, forever.

## Based On Fedora, Propelled Further By Us

Ultramarine Linux is a linux distribution which is based on Fedora Linux, sponsored by Red Hat (and in extension, IBM).

Everything possible on Fedora, is possible here as well.

## Built For The Free, Designed To Be Hassle-Free

Ultramarine Linux aims to be a linux distribution lovable by newbies and power users alike by coming pre-installed with everything you may need to kick start your productivity, gaming or casual experience.

Essentially, it is a spiritual successor to the [Korora Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korora_(operating_system)), which was a similar Fedora Remix designed for general computing.

We include repositories for our users to install necessary software like device drivers (Looking at you, NVIDIA), applications, kernel patches like F-Sync for high performance, etc.

Users are free to manipulate their build as they wish and welcome to do so!

## Stays On Its Toes, So That You Can Sprint Ahead

Ultramarine Linux stays toe-to-toe with Fedora updates, if an update for it is avaialble, it will be made available to you at the same time!

# Planned Feaures

<!-- Discuss features of UML -->
- A GUI for the user to install and configure their system, similar to OpenSUSE's YaST.
- A simplified build system for developers to easily build their packages. (Work in progress)
- Automatic detection of hardware and software integrated into the installer, for automatic driver installation.
