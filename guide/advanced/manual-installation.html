<h1>Manually installing Ultramarine Linux</h1>
<p>If you'd like a more custom install of Ultramarine, you can pick 3 different ways to make your own installation of Ultramarine Linux</p>
<h2>Using the Network Installer</h2>
<p>The network installer, also internally called the “Everything” variant, is a bootable installer ISO file containing the plain install tree for Ultramarine Linux.</p>
<p>It also serves as the main software repository for all software in Ultramarine Linux, and is configured to override all software that already existed in Fedora.</p>
<p>To use the network installer, download the bootable ISO image and flash it to a flash drive or burn it to a disc following the <a href="/guide/installation">Standard installation guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Installing without the Ultramarine Network installer</h3>
<p>You can also use the Fedora Everything installer, the Fedora Server installer, RHEL installer, Rocky Linux installer, or an installer for any Linux distribution that uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda_(installer)">Anaconda Installer</a>.</p>
<p>To do this, simply use said installer and then point the installation source to the Ultramarine repositories. You should also set up additional repositories for Fedora itself and RPMFusion, as Ultramarine in itself is not self-hosting at the moment.</p>
<h2>Building your own image</h2>
<p>To build your own custom image of Ultramarine, you can use the standard <a href="https://gitlab.ultramarine-linux.org/release-engineering/build-scripts">Kickstart scripts</a> as a starting point. Kickstart is a scripting language for the Anaconda installer that allows for custom unattended installations using the Anaconda installer. It can also be scripted in a way to be used to create a custom image.</p>
<p>To get started, please refer to the <a href="https://pykickstart.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kickstart-docs.html">PyKickstart Documentation</a>.</p>
<p>To build an image, clone the kickstart files from the Ultramarine GitLab</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">git clone https://gitlab.ultramarine-linux.org/release-engineering/build-scripts.git</code></pre>
<p>Then, edit the files as you see fit. After that you can either go 2 ways:</p>
<h3>Using Onceler to build the image</h3>
<p>Onceler is a simple wrapper for Lorax that can be used to quickly build live images from kickstart files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use it, simply edit the given <code>onceler.cfg</code> file, then run Onceler</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo onceler --variant &lt;variant&gt;</code></pre>
<h3>Using the standard Live Media Creator</h3>
<p>After you have finished configuring your kickstart configuration, flatten your kickstart files to a single file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">ksflatten -c &lt;input.ks&gt; -o &lt;output.ks&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Then, use the Live Media Creator to build the image.</p>
<p><strong>Example Command:</strong></p>
<hr>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo livemedia-creator --make-iso\
 --ks ultramarine-pantheon-flattened.ks\
 --project "Ultramarine-Pantheon-Live"\
 --releasever 35\
 --no-virt\
 --macboot\
 --iso-only\
 --resultdir result/</code></pre>
<p>For more instructions on how to use the Live Media Creator, please refer to the <a href="https://weldr.io/lorax/lorax.html">Lorax Documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>Manually bootstrapping Ultramarine using DNF</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><mark class="marker-yellow">WARNING</mark>: This method is only recommended for advanced users only. We are not responsible for broken installations, lost data, and broken components when using this method. You have been warned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you would like to take it to an another step and install Ultramarine manually like an <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide">Arch Linux installation</a>, or want an even more minimal installation for whatever purpose, You can manually bootstrap an entire chroot using DNF.</p>
<p>To get started, you need to make sure you have DNF installed in your system of choice, be it <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dnf/">Arch Linux</a>, <a href="https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/dnf">Debian</a>, or any other OS, including Fedora.</p>
<p>You need to also need to have Git installed to download the bootstrap script.</p>
<p>First, set up the partitions using your favorite partitioning tool. For simplicity, we'll be using blivet-gui to edit our partitions.</p>
<p>If you're using EFI, set up an EFI partition now.</p>
<h3>Partitioning Setup</h3>
<p>Create a small EFI partition to store all the EFI bootloader data at the beginning of the disk.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/advanced-setup/image.png"></figure>
<p>Then, create a main root partition for the system.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/advanced-setup/root.png"></figure>
<p>Optionally, you can also create a seperate home partition for personal data.</p>
<p>Once that's done, apply your changes by clicking the checkmark button on the top bar.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now the following steps will require you to use the terminal. Please make sure you already have experience using the command line before following this method.</p>
<p>Create an empty folder at the location of where you would like to mount your system.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo mkdir -p /mnt/sysroot</code></pre>
<p>Mount the partitions you have just created to the folder you have created. You can look at the list of your block devices (partitions) using <code>lsblk</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/sysroot</code></pre>
<p>For EFI users, you have to also mount your EFI partition.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo mkdir -p /mnt/sysroot/boot/efi
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sysroot/boot/efi</code></pre>
<h3>Bootstrapping Ultramarine</h3>
<p>Make sure you have DNF installed before proceeding any further.</p>
<p>Clone the DNFStrap script from the Ultramarine Gitlab.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">git clone https://gitlab.ultramarine-linux.org/extras/dnfstrap.git &amp;&amp; cd dnfstrap</code></pre>
<p>Now start the bootstrapping process. This command below will install Ultramarine based on Fedora Linux 35 at the specified chroot.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo ./dnfstrap 35 /mnt/sysroot</code></pre>
<h3>Setting up the bootloader</h3>
<p>To set up the GRUB Bootloader, chroot into the installation and install GRUB.</p>
<p>To install GRUB on an x86_64 machine, run the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">dnf install shim grub2-efi-x64 grub2-tools-efi</code></pre>
<p>And that's it! You have successfully installed Ultramarine Linux manually. Now you can install additional packages and set up your installation.</p>
