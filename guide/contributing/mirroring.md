# Mirroring Ultramarine

Mirroring the Ultramarine repos can be done by pointing `rsync` at the main repository in `rsync://lapis.ultramarine-linux.org/pub`.

This will mirror the entire repository for all versions.

You should have at least 100GB of free space on your mirror for each version, you can cut down the versions you'd like to mirror if you want to.

It is recommended to sync the mirror every hour.
