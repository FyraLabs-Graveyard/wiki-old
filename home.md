# About

Ultramarine Linux is a Linux distribution based on Fedora designed for a simple out-of-the-box experience, while giving as much power as possible to power-users alike.

# Before you get started

This wiki is aimed at users who wish to learn more about Ultramarine Linux, or Linux in general, for that matter.

We assume that our target audience are of all varities, in order to keep this wiki compatible for all, some of the information may be generalised, while uncommon things regarding this distro will be addressed on a high-level, we aim to focus this guide towards strengthening the basics of a new linux user.

We don't intend to create rift between the various factions of the Linux community (i.e distro wars, FOSS vs Proprietary, package X over package Y, etc.).

Our intention is to simplify things for our users, and we want to ensure our community that our actions are well-planned and taken in good faith.

You are obviously entitled to your opinion, and you are free to do so and so are we. We hope that our interactions always acknowledge this fact and keep our discussions as respectful as possible.

Everyone is free to contribute towards this project, be it any component/department, as long as it is in good faith and for the welfare of the community.

# Our Philosophy
Our aim is to lower the barrier of entry for desktop Linux. Although this may seem vague and can be achieved in multiple ways, we encorporate the following philosophies in our project which define what means user-friendly to us.

- Providing repositories from [COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/) or 3rd-party repositories compatible with Fedora
- Encorporating [Desktop Environments](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-desktop-environment/) like Budgie and Cutefish which are community favourites and also unique in their own regard
- Allow the user to manipulate their experience with Ultramarine as they please 
- Provide basic features one would expect from a desktop while attempting to keep [bloatware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat) to a minimum
- Encourage a speedy and efficient environment for most general computing related tasks, which may include gaming, productivity, etc.
- Provide a simple way for contributors to contribute to the project
- Let the user install any software they wish, regardless of license or origin. Unless the distribution of said software in itself is in violation of local laws
