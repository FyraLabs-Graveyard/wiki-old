# This section is dedicated for outlining the current state of Ultramarine Linux

This page addresses things like lack of content on the wiki at the moment (20th Dec, 2021 at the time of writing), missing features, etc.

This section will be filled out by respective departments
## Wiki	

- Need to create page(s) addressing press (Bloggers, YouTubers, etc). This includes images for thumbnails, potential points to be discussed for content, to whichever format it may apply to, etc.

- Need to create page(s) addressing developers and advanced users looking forward to contribute towards the project. Will mostly be highlighting contributing guidelines, vacancies, etc.

- Need to create page(s) addressing wiki contributers and standards (including grammatical standards like British English vs American, etc.)
