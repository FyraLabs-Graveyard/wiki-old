# This section is dedicated for outlining the current state of Ultramarine Linux

This page addresses things like lack of content on the wiki at the moment (20th Dec, 2021 at the time of writing), missing features, etc.

This section will be filled out by respective departments
## Wiki	

- Need to create page(s) addressing press (Bloggers, YouTubers, etc). This includes images for thumbnails, potential points to be discussed for content, to whichever format it may apply to, etc.

- Need to create page(s) addressing developers and advanced users looking forward to contribute towards the project. Will mostly be highlighting contributing guidelines, vacancies, etc.

- Need to create page(s) addressing wiki contributors and standards (including grammatical standards like British English vs American, etc.)

## Release Engineering
- [High Priority] Additional package maintainers desperately needed.
- Release engineers needed for structuring releases.

## Infrastructure
- FreeIPA should be set up for easy authentication into the Ultramarine build system.
- A platform for users to request and track package status, something like Fedora's Bodhi. Or set up Bodhi on Ultramarine Infrastructure.
